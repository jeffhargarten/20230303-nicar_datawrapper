# Introduction to DataWrapper for news graphics

Datawrapper is a powerful tool that allows you to easily visualize data as beautiful charts, maps and tables with just a few clicks.

Datawrapper was created by a team of designers, developers and journalists from news organizations including Bloomberg, Deutsche Welle, NPR, NYT and ZEIT – so it has the storytelling needs of journalists in mind.

We've been using it for years at the Star Tribune. But the last handful of years has seen it evolve into our primary news graphics and data visualization engine, completely supplanting older tools and even complex dataviz libraries like D3.

DataWrapper itself is built upon [D3](https://d3js.org/), and democratizes the library's power and flexibility to non-coders.

All DataWrapper graphics are easily embeddable in most CMS.

It can also export digital graphics as SVGs and other formats for use in print.

It has free and subscription tiers, with the latter providing custom styles and support.


## Getting started

1. [Make a free account at DataWrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/)

2. [Open our data examples Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SXw_iuyY7ot6xglBG9fQyBQSA2n3SRus3anTyby535k/edit?usp=sharing) – most of this data is fake, so don't take it literally!

3. Start playing around and experimenting with different chart types!
